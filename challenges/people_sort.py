# People Sort
# Given a list of people objects, create a function that sorts the list by an attribute name. The attribute to sort by will be given as a string.

# The Person class will only include these attributes in the following order:

# firstname
# lastname
# age
# Examples
# p1 = Person("Michael", "Smith", 40)
# p2 = Person("Alice", "Waters", 21)
# p3 = Person("Zoey", "Jones", 29)
# people_sort([p1, p2, p3], "firstname") ➞ [p2, p1, p3]
# # Alice, Michael, Zoey

# people_sort([p1, p2, p3], "lastname") ➞ [p3, p1, p2]
# # Jones, Smith, Waters

# people_sort([p1, p2, p3], "age") ➞ [p2, p3, p1]
# # 21, 29, 40
# Notes
# Sort the list in ASCENDING order.
# All objects will be valid.
